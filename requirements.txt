# RSS Feed Backend - Requirements
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file now uses a split requirements structure:
# - requirements-prod.txt: Production dependencies (SECURITY HARDENED)
# - requirements-dev.txt: Development + Production dependencies
#
# For production deployment:
#   pip install -r requirements-prod.txt
#
# For local development:
#   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#
# Legacy compatibility: This file still includes all dependencies
# but you should migrate to using requirements-prod.txt or requirements-dev.txt

# Production requirements (security hardened)
-r requirements-prod.txt

# Development and testing (if needed)
# Uncomment for local development:
# -r requirements-dev.txt
