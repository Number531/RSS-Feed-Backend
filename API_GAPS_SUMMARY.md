# Backend API Gaps - Executive Summary

## 🚨 Critical Issues Found

### ❌ **BLOCKER #1: No RSS Feed Management**
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Feature completely missing

The most critical gap: **RSS feed management endpoints don't exist!**

**Impact:**
- Users cannot see what feeds are available
- No way to add/remove feeds
- Cannot subscribe to specific feeds
- Frontend has no way to display feed sources

**Database Model:** ✅ Exists (`rss_source.py`)  
**API Endpoints:** ❌ **MISSING ENTIRELY**

**Required:**
```
GET    /feeds              # List all RSS feeds
GET    /feeds/{id}         # Get feed details
POST   /feeds              # Add feed (admin)
PUT    /feeds/{id}         # Update feed (admin)
DELETE /feeds/{id}         # Remove feed (admin)
GET    /feeds/categories   # List categories
```

### ❌ **BLOCKER #2: No User Subscriptions**
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Core UX missing

**Problem:**
- All users see ALL articles from ALL feeds
- No personalization
- Cannot filter by preferred sources

**Required:**
- New database table: `user_feed_subscriptions`
- Subscribe/unsubscribe endpoints
- Feed preference management

---

### ⚠️ **BLOCKER #3: User Stats Returns 501**
**Status:** 🟡 HIGH - Endpoint exists but not implemented

The `/users/me/stats` endpoint returns "Not Implemented" error!

**Impact:**
- Profile page stats don't work
- Cannot display user engagement
- No gamification possible

---

### ⚠️ **BLOCKER #4: No File Uploads**
**Status:** 🟡 HIGH - Poor UX

**Problem:**
- Users endpoint accepts `avatar_url` as string only
- No way to actually upload avatar images
- Must use external hosting

**Required:**
- File upload handler
- Image validation & optimization
- Storage solution (local/S3/R2)

## 🎯 Priority Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1-2):
1. 🔴 **RSS Feed Management** - Critical blocker
2. 🔴 **User Subscriptions** - Core UX
3. 🟡 **User Stats** - Fix broken endpoint
4. 🟡 **Content Moderation** - Safety

### High Priority (Week 3-4):
5. 🟡 **File Uploads** - Avatar support
6. 🟡 **Article Filtering** - Better UX
7. 🟡 **Notification Polish** - Complete system

### Medium Priority (Later):
8. 🟢 Social features
9. 🟢 Article reactions
10. 🟢 Advanced search

---

## 💡 Quick Wins

### Easy Implementations:
1. **User Stats Endpoint** (~2 hours)
   - Just aggregate existing data
   - No new tables needed

2. **Article Filtering** (~4 hours)
   - Add query parameters to existing endpoint
   - Filter by category, source, date

3. **Health Check** (~1 hour)
   - Add `/health` endpoint
   - Basic status monitoring

---

## 🚀 Action Items

**For Backend Team:**
1. Create `/feeds` endpoint group (Priority 1)
2. Design subscription system schema
3. Implement user stats aggregation
4. Add file upload handler

**For Frontend Team:**
1. Wait for feed endpoints before feed UI
2. Profile stats currently won't load
3. Avatar upload won't work yet

**For Product:**
1. Decide on feed management permissions
2. Choose storage solution for uploads
3. Define moderation workflow
4. Prioritize social features
