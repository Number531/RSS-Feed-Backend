# API Endpoint Gap Analysis

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-10  
**Current Status**: Pre-Dependency Injection Implementation

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Before implementing dependency injection, we need to determine which API endpoints should be included. This analysis reviews existing endpoints, identifies gaps, and recommends a comprehensive API structure.

---

## 📊 Current State

### ✅ **Existing Endpoints**

#### **Authentication** (`/api/v1/auth`)
- ✅ `POST /register` - User registration
- ✅ `POST /login` - User login
- ✅ `POST /refresh` - Token refresh

#### **Articles** (`/api/v1/articles`) - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ `GET /` - Get articles feed (with filtering/sorting)
- ✅ `GET /search` - Search articles
- ✅ `GET /{article_id}` - Get single article

### ❌ **Missing Endpoints**

#### **Votes** (`/api/v1/votes`) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ All vote endpoints missing

#### **Comments** (`/api/v1/comments`) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ All comment endpoints missing

#### **Users** (`/api/v1/users`) - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ User profile endpoints missing

## 🔍 Recommended API Endpoint Structure

### 1️⃣ **Articles Endpoints** (`/api/v1/articles`)

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| GET | `/` | Get articles feed | Optional | ✅ Exists |
| GET | `/search` | Search articles | Optional | ✅ Exists |
| GET | `/{article_id}` | Get article details | Optional | ✅ Exists |

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - No additional endpoints needed for articles

---

### 2️⃣ **Votes Endpoints** (`/api/v1/votes`) ⚠️ PRIORITY

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| POST | `/` | Cast/update vote | Required | ❌ Missing |
| DELETE | `/{article_id}` | Remove vote | Required | ❌ Missing |
| GET | `/article/{article_id}` | Get user's vote | Required | ❌ Missing |

**Recommendation**: ✅ **IMPLEMENT BEFORE DI**

**Why?**
- Core functionality for the application
- Service layer already complete
- Simple endpoints (3 total)
- Enables full voting feature

**Implementation Effort**: ~2 hours

---

### 3️⃣ **Comments Endpoints** (`/api/v1/comments`) ⚠️ PRIORITY

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| POST | `/` | Create comment | Required | ❌ Missing |
| GET | `/article/{article_id}` | Get article comments | Optional | ❌ Missing |
| GET | `/{comment_id}` | Get single comment | Optional | ❌ Missing |
| GET | `/{comment_id}/replies` | Get comment replies | Optional | ❌ Missing |
| PUT | `/{comment_id}` | Update comment | Required | ❌ Missing |
| DELETE | `/{comment_id}` | Delete comment | Required | ❌ Missing |

**Recommendation**: ✅ **IMPLEMENT BEFORE DI**

**Why?**
- Core functionality for the application
- Service layer already complete
- Enables full commenting feature
- Supports threaded discussions

**Implementation Effort**: ~3 hours

---

### 4️⃣ **Users Endpoints** (`/api/v1/users`) ⚠️ OPTIONAL

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| GET | `/me` | Get current user profile | Required | ❌ Missing |
| PUT | `/me` | Update profile | Required | ❌ Missing |
| GET | `/{user_id}` | Get user profile | Optional | ❌ Missing |
| GET | `/{user_id}/comments` | Get user's comments | Optional | ❌ Missing |
| GET | `/{user_id}/votes` | Get user's votes | Optional | ❌ Missing |

**Recommendation**: ⏭️ **DEFER TO LATER**

**Why?**
- Not critical for core functionality
- Can be added incrementally
- No service layer yet (would need UserService)
- Lower priority than votes/comments

**Implementation Effort**: ~4 hours (including service layer)

---

### 5️⃣ **RSS Sources Endpoints** (`/api/v1/sources`) ⚠️ OPTIONAL

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|--------|
| GET | `/` | List RSS sources | Optional | ❌ Missing |
| POST | `/` | Add RSS source (admin) | Admin | ❌ Missing |
| PUT | `/{source_id}` | Update source (admin) | Admin | ❌ Missing |
| DELETE | `/{source_id}` | Delete source (admin) | Admin | ❌ Missing |

**Recommendation**: ⏭️ **DEFER TO LATER**

**Why?**
- Admin functionality
- Not user-facing
- Lower priority
- Can be added later

## 💡 Rationale for Recommendation

### **Why Implement Votes & Comments First?**

1. **Service Layer Ready** ✅
   - VoteService: Complete and tested
   - CommentService: Complete and tested
   - Just need to add API layer

2. **Core Functionality** ⭐
   - Votes and comments are essential features
   - Users expect to interact with articles
   - Completes the MVP feature set

3. **Clean DI Implementation** 🎯
   - Better to have all core endpoints before DI
   - Implement DI once for all features
   - Avoid partial implementations

4. **Testing Efficiency** 🧪
   - Test all core features together
   - Comprehensive integration tests
   - Better coverage

5. **User Experience** 👥
   - Complete feature set from day 1
   - No "coming soon" placeholders
   - Professional release

### **Why Defer Users & Sources?**

1. **Users Endpoints**:
   - Profile management is secondary
   - Users can comment/vote without profile pages
   - Can add incrementally based on need

2. **Sources Endpoints**:
   - Admin functionality only
   - RSS sources managed via backend/CLI
   - Not user-facing

## 📝 Next Steps

### If You Agree with Recommendation:

1. ✅ Approve implementation of Votes + Comments endpoints
2. ⏭️ Defer Users + Sources endpoints
3. 🚀 Proceed with implementation:
   - Step 1: Create `votes.py` endpoint
   - Step 2: Create `comments.py` endpoint
   - Step 3: Update API router
   - Step 4: Implement dependency injection
   - Step 5: Test complete system

### Alternative Path:

If you prefer to proceed with DI first:
- We can implement DI now
- Add endpoints incrementally later
- This is a valid approach but less optimal

---

**Question for You**: Would you like me to implement the **Votes** and **Comments** endpoints before we proceed with dependency injection? This would give us a complete core API ready for production.
