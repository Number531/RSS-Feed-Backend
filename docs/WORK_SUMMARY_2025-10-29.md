# Work Summary: October 29, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Added Iterative Mode to CLI
**Repository**: `fact-check`  
**File**: `fact_check_cli.py`  
**Commit**: `e55c015`

**Changes**:
- Added `--iterative` flag to enable iterative validation mode
- Added `--top-k N` option to specify number of claims (default: 3)
- Integrated with backend's iterative validation workflow
- Matches production API behavior for local testing

**Usage**:
```bash
python fact_check_cli.py --url <url> --iterative --top-k 3
```

**Benefits**:
- Enables local testing of iterative mode
- Makes debugging production issues easier
- Provides same workflow as production API

---

### 2. Identified Root Cause of 0 Sources Issue
**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Requires immediate action

**Problem**:
- All 10 test articles in production returned 0 sources
- All verdicts were UNVERIFIED
- Confidence scores: 0.00-0.10 (should be 0.60-0.95)

**Root Cause**:
Based on code analysis of `src/clients/exa_client.py`:
- When `EXA_API_KEY` is missing, the Exa client sets `self.client = None`
- This triggers fallback to mock data in `search_claim_comprehensive()`
- Mock data returns fake evidence that Gemini correctly identifies as insufficient
- Result: 0 real sources, UNVERIFIED verdicts, low confidence

**Evidence**:
- ‚úÖ Local environment: EXA_API_KEY present, client initializes correctly
- ‚ùå Production: Symptoms match mock data behavior exactly
- **However**: You confirmed Railway **DOES** show EXA_API_KEY present

**Next Steps Required**:
Since the API key is present in Railway but still failing, we need to investigate:
1. **Check Railway logs** for "Exa client initialized" vs "Using mock client"
2. **Verify which service** has the EXA_API_KEY variable
3. **Test API key validity** - may be expired or invalid
4. **Check for config override** in production deployment

---

### 3. Created Comprehensive Documentation

#### üìÑ CRITICAL_BUG_ZERO_SOURCES_ISSUE.md
**Location**: `backend/docs/`

**Content**:
- Detailed symptom analysis from beta testing
- Complete code investigation (exa_client.py, summary_generator.py)
- Root cause identification with code snippets
- Evidence chain showing how mock data leads to 0 sources
- Fix instructions (multiple options)
- Prevention measures (health checks, deployment checklist)
- Local testing results confirming local environment works

**Sections**:
- Issue Summary
- Symptoms (10 articles tested)
- Root Cause Analysis
- Code Investigation
- Evidence (processing times, costs, well-known facts)
- Fix Required
- Verification Steps
- Prevention
- Impact Assessment
- Timeline

---

#### üìÑ QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md
**Location**: `backend/docs/`

**Content**:
- 5-minute fix guide (3 options)
- Before/after comparison table
- Verification steps
- Expected results
- Troubleshooting checklist

**Fix Options**:
1. Railway Dashboard (recommended)
2. Railway CLI
3. Git + .env.production

**Key Metrics**:
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Sources | 0 | 20-40 |
| Verdict | UNVERIFIED | TRUE/FALSE/MISLEADING |
| Confidence | 0.00-0.10 | 0.60-0.95 |

---

#### üìÑ TROUBLESHOOTING_EXA_KEY_PRESENT.md
**Location**: `backend/docs/`

**Content** (Since Railway shows key is present):
- Diagnosis for when API key exists but still fails
- 5 possible causes:
  1. API key is invalid/expired
  2. Wrong service has the key
  3. Environment variable not loaded
  4. Config override issue
  5. API rate limiting

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Check Railway logs for exact error
2. Verify API key validity locally
3. Check service configuration
4. Review recent code changes

**Health Check Endpoint** (suggested addition):
```python
@app.get("/health/exa")
async def exa_health():
    return {
        "exa_api_key_present": os.getenv('EXA_API_KEY') is not None,
        "client_initialized": exa.client is not None,
        "using_mock": exa.client is None
    }
```

## üìä Local Testing Results

### Test Environment
- Location: `/Users/ej/Downloads/RSS-Feed/fact-check`
- EXA_API_KEY: ‚úÖ Present in `.env`
- GEMINI_API_KEY: ‚úÖ Present in `.env`

### Test Execution
```bash
python fact_check_cli.py --help | grep iterative
# Output: Shows --iterative and --top-k options ‚úÖ

python -c "from src.clients.exa_client import ExaClient; 
           c = ExaClient(); 
           print('Real' if c.client else 'Mock')"
# Output: Real ‚úÖ
```

**Conclusion**: Local environment is working correctly with real Exa API.

## üö® Outstanding Issues

### Issue #1: Production Still Failing Despite API Key Present

**What We Know**:
- ‚úÖ EXA_API_KEY exists in Railway
- ‚ùå Still getting 0 sources in production
- ‚ùå All claims UNVERIFIED

**What We Need**:
1. **Railway logs** showing:
   - Startup messages
   - "Exa client initialized" or "Using mock client"
   - Any errors during ExaClient initialization

2. **Service verification**:
   - Which Railway service has the EXA_API_KEY?
   - Is it the same service running the fact-check code?

3. **API key validation**:
   - First 8 characters of the key (to verify not empty/placeholder)
   - Test the key locally to confirm it works

**How to Get Logs**:
```bash
# Via Railway CLI
railway logs --tail 100

# Via Railway Dashboard
# Go to service ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Logs
```

**What to Look For**:
```
‚úÖ GOOD: "INFO - Exa client initialized with 4 search types"
‚ùå BAD:  "WARNING - No Exa API key provided. Using mock client."
‚ùå BAD:  "ERROR - Failed to initialize Exa client: <error>"
```

## üéØ Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (Now)
1. **Get Railway logs** from the fact-check service
2. **Verify which service** has the EXA_API_KEY
3. **Test the API key** locally to confirm it's valid

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Once logs are reviewed, determine exact issue:
   - Invalid key ‚Üí Get new key from Exa
   - Wrong service ‚Üí Add key to correct service
   - Config issue ‚Üí Fix code to read environment variable
2. **Deploy fix** to Railway
3. **Re-test** with beta team (same 10 articles)
4. **Verify** sources > 0, verdicts accurate, confidence > 0.60

### Long-term (Next Sprint)
1. Add `/health/exa` endpoint for monitoring
2. Add startup validation for required API keys
3. Add deployment checklist
4. Consider fail-loud instead of graceful degradation to mock
