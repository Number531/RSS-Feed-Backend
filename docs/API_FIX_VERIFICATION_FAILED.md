**Date:** October 30, 2025 02:55 UTC  
**Status:** 🔴 **ISSUE NOT RESOLVED**

## Test Results

### **Direct API Test:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "796bfb68-28f9-4267-8bad-58ca31f0cf18",
  "validation_mode": "iterative",
  "claims_analyzed": 3,
  "validation_results": [
    {
      "claim": "The U.S. is scaling back its military presence in Romania...",
      "verdict": "UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE",
      "evidence_count": 0,
      "confidence": 0.1
    },
    {
      "claim": "The Pentagon denies this is an American withdrawal from Europe...",
      "verdict": "UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE",
      "evidence_count": 0,
      "confidence": 1.0
    },
    {
      "claim": "Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker...",
      "verdict": "UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE",
      "evidence_count": 0,
      "confidence": 0.05
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Backend Integration Test:**
- 10 articles processed
- All 10 show: UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
- Evidence sources: 0 for all articles
- Average credibility score: 49.9/100

---

## Verdict

❌ **The evidence search issue is NOT fixed.**

- API still returns `evidence_count: 0` for all claims
- No sources are being found
- Issue persists exactly as before

---

## What Was Tested

### Test Article:
**URL:** https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-scales-back-troops-from-nato-eastern-flank-denies-american-withdrawal-from-europe

**Claims That Should Be Verifiable:**
1. "U.S. scaling back military presence in Romania" - **Major news** → 0 sources found
2. "Pentagon denies withdrawal from Europe" - **Official statement** → 0 sources found  
3. "Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman statement" - **Public record** → 0 sources found

---

## Recommendation

**The fact-check API microservice team needs to:**

1. **Verify the fix was deployed**
   - Check Railway deployment status
   - Confirm latest code is running
   - Verify environment variables updated

2. **Check API logs for evidence search**
   ```bash
   railway logs -p fact-check-production | grep -i "evidence\|search\|exa\|perplexity"
   ```

3. **Test evidence search directly**
   - Verify Exa API is being called
   - Check Perplexity API connectivity
   - Confirm search queries are being generated

4. **Possible issues to investigate:**
   - API keys still invalid/not loaded
   - Feature flag not enabled
   - Search service not initialized
   - Network/firewall blocking external API calls
   - Code deployment didn't complete

---

## Backend Status

✅ **Backend is working correctly and ready.**

We have:
- Fixed API response parsing ✅
- Correct data structure ✅
- Proper error handling ✅
- Ready to receive proper fact-check results ✅

**We are blocked on the fact-check API evidence search fix.**

---

## Next Test

Once the API team confirms another fix, we can retest immediately:

```bash
cd /Users/ej/Downloads/RSS-Feed/backend
python scripts/testing/complete_fox_politics_test.py
```

Expected after real fix:
- Evidence counts > 0
- Mix of verdicts (TRUE, FALSE, MISLEADING, UNVERIFIED)
- Higher confidence scores (> 0.5 for verified claims)
- Source citations in evidence summaries

---

**Status:** Waiting for fact-check API team to investigate and deploy actual fix.
