## Detailed Article Analysis

### Article 1: Paris Louvre Heist
**URL:** https://www.foxnews.com/politics/paris-prosecutor-says-apprehended-louvre-heist-suspects-spoken-102m-crown-jewels-remain-missing

**Claims Extracted:**
1. ‚úÖ "Two suspects arrested in Louvre heist" (HIGH risk)
2. ‚úÖ "Four thieves stole $102M in crown jewels on Oct 19" (HIGH risk)
3. ‚úÖ "Paris prosecutor Beccuau said suspects admitted involvement" (HIGH risk)

**Validation Results:**
- ‚ùå Verdict: N/A (should be TRUE/FALSE/MISLEADING)
- ‚ùå Confidence: 0.00 (should be 0.0-1.0)
- ‚ùå Sources: 0 (should have found news sources)

**Issue:** Claims are properly extracted and categorized as "Iterative Claim" with HIGH risk, but validation step appears to have failed completely.

## Technical Analysis

### What's Working ‚úÖ

1. **Claim Extraction:** All claims properly extracted with appropriate categorization
2. **Risk Assessment:** All claims correctly marked as "HIGH risk"
3. **Claim Structure:** Proper JSON format with 'claim', 'category', 'risk_level'
4. **Processing Speed:** Improved from previous run (avg 122s vs 155s)
5. **API Connectivity:** No timeouts or connection errors
6. **Cost Tracking:** Accurate cost breakdown maintained

### What's Broken ‚ùå

1. **Validation Step:** No verdicts being generated (all "N/A")
2. **Evidence Search:** Zero sources found for any article
3. **Confidence Scoring:** All confidence scores are 0.00
4. **Final Verdict:** All articles defaulting to UNVERIFIED
5. **Data Persistence:** validation_results array contains claim objects instead of validation results

### Data Structure Mismatch

**Expected Structure:**
```json
{
  "claim": "...",
  "validation_result": {
    "verdict": "TRUE",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "evidence_summary": "...",
    "sources": [...]
  }
}
```

**Actual Structure:**
```json
{
  "claim": "...",
  "category": "Iterative Claim",
  "risk_level": "HIGH",
  "verdict": "N/A",
  "confidence": 0.00
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: API Response Schema Change

The microservice update appears to have changed the response format for iterative mode:

**Old Response (working):**
```json
{
  "validation_results": [
    {
      "claim": "...",
      "validation_result": {
        "verdict": "TRUE",
        "confidence": 0.85
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**New Response (current):**
```json
{
  "claims": [...],  // Extracted claims
  "validation_results": [...],  // Should contain verdicts but appears empty
  "metadata": {
    "iterative_metadata": {
      "iterations_completed": 2,
      "issues_found": 0,
      "article_accuracy": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

### Hypothesis

The backend service is receiving the `claims` array (extracted claims) instead of the `validation_results` array (validated claims with verdicts). This suggests:

1. The microservice is successfully extracting claims
2. The validation step (evidence search + verdict determination) is not completing
3. The backend is storing the extracted claims in the `validation_results` column

## Impact Assessment

### Production Impact: **CRITICAL** üî¥

- **User-facing:** All articles show as "UNVERIFIED" with no useful fact-check data
- **Credibility scoring:** All sources stuck at 50/100 (neutral)
- **Frontend display:** No verdicts, confidence scores, or evidence to show users
- **API value:** Near-zero value to end users in current state

### Data Integrity: **COMPROMISED** üü†

- 10 articles with incomplete/incorrect fact-check data in database
- validation_results column contains wrong data type (claims vs validations)
- All denormalized fields (fact_check_score, fact_check_verdict) are incorrect

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Fetch Raw API Response**
   ```bash
   curl "https://fact-check-production.up.railway.app/fact-check/{job_id}/result"
   ```
   - Pick any job_id from the 10 completed jobs
   - Examine the full response structure
   - Compare with expected schema from integration docs

2. **Check Microservice Logs**
   - Review Railway logs for the fact-check service
   - Look for validation step errors or timeouts
   - Check if evidence search is running

3. **Verify Service Configuration**
   - Confirm `USE_ITERATIVE_SUMMARY=true`
   - Check `ENABLE_PARALLEL_VALIDATION=true`
   - Verify Exa/Perplexity API keys are valid

### Short-term Fixes

1. **Update Backend Mapping**
   - Modify `FactCheckService.poll_and_complete_job()` to handle new schema
   - Map the correct fields from API response to database columns
   - Add defensive checks for missing/null validation data

2. **Add Validation Checks**
   - Reject fact-check results with 0 sources
   - Set verdict to ERROR instead of UNVERIFIED when validation fails
   - Log detailed errors for debugging

3. **Reprocess Failed Articles**
   - Clear the 10 incorrect fact-checks
   - Re-run fact-checking once API issue is resolved

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Schema Versioning**
   - Add API version field to track fact-check API schema changes
   - Implement backward-compatible parsing

2. **Validation Quality Checks**
   - Alert when fact-checks complete with 0 sources
   - Set minimum confidence thresholds (e.g., reject < 0.20)

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up alerts for high UNVERIFIED rates
   - Monitor average source counts per fact-check
   - Track confidence score distributions

## Test Job IDs for Investigation

Use these job IDs to fetch raw API responses:

1. `f3079aa3-c565-4b7e-a36d-d846624d1fd6` (NYC Mayoral - 112s)
2. `00379d6d-af3d-4b53-81ba-d4946241f5d6` (Trump-Xi - 104s, fastest)
3. `e4732997-b63b-47aa-9466-9642f2951eb5` (Memphis - 142s, slowest)

**Fetch command:**
```bash
curl -s "https://fact-check-production.up.railway.app/fact-check/f3079aa3-c565-4b7e-a36d-d846624d1fd6/result" | jq '.' > raw_response.json
```

---

## Conclusion

The microservice update has introduced a **critical breaking change** in the API response schema. While claim extraction is working perfectly (all 30 claims across 10 articles extracted correctly), the validation step is either:

1. Not running at all, or
2. Running but returning results in a different format that our backend doesn't recognize

**Status:** üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Cannot proceed with production deployment until validation results are properly returned and stored.

**Priority:** üî• **HIGHEST** - This is a showstopper for the fact-checking feature.

**Owner:** Backend + Fact-Check API Teams

**Target Resolution:** Within 24 hours
