**Reddit Has:** Real-time notifications for mentions, replies, votes, etc.  
**You Have:** Nothing  
**Effort:** High (15-20 hours)  
**Recommendation:** **Essential for v1.5** - Core engagement feature

**Required Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/v1/notifications/                    List notifications
GET    /api/v1/notifications/unread              Get unread count
POST   /api/v1/notifications/{id}/mark-read      Mark as read
POST   /api/v1/notifications/mark-all-read       Mark all as read
DELETE /api/v1/notifications/{id}                Delete notification
```

---

#### 2. **User Content Submission** ❌
**Impact:** Platform relies entirely on RSS feeds; users can't share content  
**Reddit Has:** Users can submit links and text posts  
**You Have:** Only RSS-automated content

**Recommendation:** **Consider for v2.0** - Changes content model

**Required Endpoints:**

POST   /api/v1/articles/validate                 Validate URL before submission
