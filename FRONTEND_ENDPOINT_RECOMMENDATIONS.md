## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Additional Endpoints

Based on typical Reddit-style and news aggregation UI patterns, here are endpoints to consider:

### 1. **Article Interactions Summary** (High Priority)
**Use Case**: Display engagement stats on article cards

```
GET /api/v1/articles/{article_id}/stats
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "article_id": "uuid",
  "vote_score": 245,
  "upvote_count": 312,
  "downvote_count": 67,
  "comment_count": 48,
  "bookmark_count": 23,
  "view_count": 1523,
  "share_count": 15
}
```

**Why?** Currently spread across multiple endpoints. A single stats endpoint improves frontend performance.

---

### 2. **User Activity Feed** (High Priority)
**Use Case**: "My Activity" page showing user's recent actions

```
GET /api/v1/users/me/activity
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `activity_type`: votes, comments, bookmarks, articles_read
- `page`, `page_size`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "type": "comment",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-15T12:00:00Z",
      "article": { /* article object */ },
      "comment": { /* comment object */ }
    },
    {
      "type": "vote",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-15T11:00:00Z",
      "article": { /* article object */ },
      "vote_value": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why?** Users want to see their own activity history in one place.

---

### 3. **Related Articles** (Medium Priority)
**Use Case**: "You might also like" or "Related articles" section

```
GET /api/v1/articles/{article_id}/related
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `limit`: Number of related articles (default: 5, max: 20)
- `method`: similarity, same_category, same_source

**Response:**
```json
{
  "related": [
    {
      "article": { /* article object */ },
      "similarity_score": 0.87,
      "reason": "same_category"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation:** Use category + tags for basic similarity, or content-based later.

**Why?** Increases user engagement and time-on-site.

---

### 4. **Batch Operations** (Medium Priority)
**Use Case**: Multi-select actions (mark multiple articles as read, bulk bookmark)

```
POST /api/v1/articles/batch
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "article_ids": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"],
  "action": "mark_read" | "bookmark" | "unbookmark"
}
```

**Why?** Better UX for power users managing many articles.

---

### 5. **User Karma/Reputation** (Low Priority)
**Use Case**: Display user reputation/contribution score

```
GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}/karma
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "total_karma": 1234,
  "breakdown": {
    "article_votes_received": 856,
    "comment_votes_received": 378,
    "comments_posted": 124,
    "articles_shared": 15
  }
}
```

**Why?** Gamification encourages quality contributions.

---

### 6. **Personalized Feed** (Low Priority)
**Use Case**: AI/ML-powered personalized article recommendations

```
GET /api/v1/articles/for-you
```

**Query Parameters:**
- `page`, `page_size`

**Response:** Similar to regular article feed but personalized based on:
- Reading history
- Bookmarks
- Votes
- Time spent on articles

**Why?** Improves content discovery for engaged users.

---

### 7. **Article Sharing** (Low Priority)
**Use Case**: Generate shareable links, track shares

```
POST /api/v1/articles/{article_id}/share
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "platform": "twitter" | "facebook" | "email" | "copy_link"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "share_url": "https://yoursite.com/articles/abc123",
  "share_count": 16
}
```

**Why?** Social sharing drives traffic and growth.

---

### 8. **Comment Sorting Options** (Medium Priority - Quick Win)
**Enhance existing comment endpoint**

```
GET /api/v1/comments/article/{article_id}?sort_by=hot
```

**Add sorting options:**
- `hot` (default) - Reddit's "hot" algorithm âœ… Already exists
- `new` - Chronological âœ… Already exists  
- `top` - Most upvoted âœ… Already exists
- `controversial` - High engagement, mixed votes âœ… Already exists
- `q&a` - Top-level comments by votes, then replies by votes (NEW)
- `old` - Reverse chronological (NEW)

**Status:** Mostly implemented, just add `q&a` and `old` modes.

---

### 9. **Reading Lists/Collections** (Low Priority)
**Use Case**: Organize bookmarks into named collections

```
POST /api/v1/collections
GET /api/v1/collections
PUT /api/v1/collections/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/collections/{id}
POST /api/v1/collections/{id}/articles
```

**Why?** Better bookmark organization for power users.

---

### 10. **Export User Data** (Low Priority - GDPR Compliance)
**Use Case**: Allow users to download their data

```
GET /api/v1/users/me/export
```

**Response:** JSON file with all user data:
- Profile
- Comments
- Votes
- Bookmarks
- Reading history

**Why?** GDPR compliance, user trust.

## Priority Recommendations for Frontend

### ðŸš€ **Must-Have Before Frontend Launch:**

1. âœ… **Article Interactions Summary** - Already have data, just aggregate it
   - Improves frontend performance significantly
   - Easy to implement

2. âœ… **User Activity Feed** - Enhances user engagement
   - Moderate complexity
   - High user value

### ðŸŽ¯ **Nice-to-Have (Phase 2):**

3. **Related Articles** - Improves content discovery
4. **Batch Operations** - Better UX for power users
5. **Enhanced Comment Sorting** - Add `q&a` and `old` modes

### ðŸ’¡ **Future Enhancements (Phase 3):**

6. User Karma/Reputation
7. Personalized Feed (requires ML)
8. Article Sharing
9. Reading Lists/Collections
10. Export User Data

---

## Current Endpoint Count: 60

### If You Add Recommended Endpoints:

**Phase 1 (Must-Have):**
- Article Stats: +1
- User Activity: +1
- **Total: 62 endpoints**

**Phase 2 (Nice-to-Have):**
- Related Articles: +1
- Batch Operations: +1
- Enhanced Sorting: +0 (modify existing)
- **Total: 64 endpoints**

**Phase 3 (Future):**
- User Karma: +1
- Personalized Feed: +1
- Article Sharing: +1
- Collections: +5
- Export Data: +1
- **Total: 73 endpoints**

---

## Assessment: Are You Ready for Frontend?

### âœ… **YES - You Have Everything Essential**

Your current 60 endpoints cover:
- âœ… Complete authentication flow
- âœ… Full CRUD for all resources
- âœ… Social features (votes, comments, bookmarks)
- âœ… Search and discovery
- âœ… Notifications
- âœ… User preferences
- âœ… Reading history and recommendations
- âœ… Admin tools

### ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Wins to Consider (Optional)**

Only these 2 endpoints would significantly improve frontend UX:

1. **`GET /api/v1/articles/{id}/stats`** (15 min to implement)
   - Reduces frontend API calls from 3-4 to 1
   - Better performance for article cards

2. **`GET /api/v1/users/me/activity`** (30 min to implement)
   - Enables "My Activity" page
   - Better user engagement tracking

**Estimated Total Time: 45 minutes**

Everything else can wait for Phase 2 after frontend launch.

## Final Recommendation

### ðŸš€ **Option 1: Start Frontend Now** (Recommended)
- Your current 60 endpoints are **production-ready**
- All core features covered
- Can add the 2 quick wins later if needed

### âš¡ **Option 2: Add Quick Wins (45 min) Then Start Frontend**
- Implement article stats + user activity
- Slightly better frontend performance
- More complete feature set

**My Recommendation:** Start frontend development now. Your API is comprehensive and production-ready. Add the quick wins only if you find you need them during frontend development.
