## 🔄 Integration Points

### 1. Vote Events → Notifications
**Location**: `comment_vote_service.py`

```
User A votes on User B's comment
    ↓
Check if User B has vote notifications enabled
    ↓
Create notification for User B
    ↓
User B sees notification in their feed
```

### 2. Reply Events → Notifications
**Location**: `comment_service.py`

```
User A replies to User B's comment
    ↓
Check if User B has reply notifications enabled
    ↓
Create notification for User B
    ↓
User B sees notification in their feed
```

### 3. Registration → Default Preferences
**Location**: `auth.py`

```
New user registers
    ↓
Create default notification preferences
    ↓
User has all notifications enabled by default
```

       /     Unit Tests     \  (50+ tests)
      /______________________\
```

### Coverage Goals
- **Unit Tests**: 100% coverage of models, services, schemas
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints, event triggers
- **Manual Tests**: End-to-end user flows

---

## ⚡ Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- **Indexes** on frequently queried columns
- **Partial indexes** for unread notifications
- **Pagination** to limit result sets
- **Query optimization** with proper joins

### Expected Performance
- API Response: < 200ms
- Notification Creation: < 50ms
- Unread Count Query: < 10ms
- Mark All Read: < 100ms

---

## 🛡️ Security & Authorization

### Access Control
✅ Users can only view their own notifications
✅ Users can only modify their own notifications
✅ Users can only update their own preferences
✅ Self-notifications are prevented
✅ All endpoints require authentication

### Data Validation
✅ UUIDs validated
✅ Enum values validated
✅ Input sanitized
✅ SQL injection prevented (using ORMs)

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- ✅ All Phase 1 tests still passing (10/10)
- ✅ All Phase 3 tests passing (30+/30+)
- ✅ Zero regression issues
- ✅ All endpoints responding correctly

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ Code coverage > 90%
- ✅ API response times < 200ms
- ✅ Database queries optimized
- ✅ Zero N+1 query problems
- ✅ Memory usage stable

## ✅ Ready Checklist

Before starting implementation, ensure:
- [x] Phase 1 complete and tested
- [x] All Phase 1 tests passing (10/10)
- [x] Database connection working
- [x] Server running without errors
- [x] Documentation reviewed
- [x] Time allocated (4-6 hours)

---

## 🎯 Implementation Order

**Recommended Sequence**:
1. **Database** (foundation)
2. **Models** (data structures)
3. **Schemas** (validation)
4. **Services** (business logic)
5. **API** (external interface)
6. **Integration** (connect systems)
7. **Tests** (verify everything)

**Why this order?**
- Each layer depends on the previous
- Can test each layer independently
- Catches issues early
- Provides clear progress indicators

---

## 🎊 Expected Outcome

After successful implementation:

```
✅ 2 new database tables
✅ 2 new models with relationships
✅ 5+ new Pydantic schemas
✅ 2 new service classes
✅ 9 new API endpoints
✅ 3 integration points
✅ 30+ passing integration tests
✅ Full notification system operational
✅ Users can manage their notifications
✅ Zero breaking changes to existing features
```

**Result**: A production-ready notification system that enhances user engagement while maintaining system stability and performance.
