# Phase 3.5: Active Notification System Integrations

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully integrated the notification system into user interactions with full async architecture. Users now receive real-time notifications for votes and replies to their content. All integration tests passing (10/10).

## Implemented Features

### 1. User Registration → Notification Preferences
**File:** `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py`

When a new user registers, default notification preferences are automatically created:
- ✅ Vote notifications: ENABLED
- ✅ Reply notifications: ENABLED  
- ✅ Mention notifications: ENABLED
- ❌ Email notifications: DISABLED

**Implementation:**
- Runs asynchronously within the same async session
- Creates preferences immediately during registration
- Fails gracefully - registration succeeds even if preference creation fails
- Logs warnings for debugging

### 2. Comment Votes → Vote Notifications
**File:** `app/services/comment_vote_service.py`

When a user upvotes a comment, the comment author receives a notification:
- ✅ Only upvotes trigger notifications (downvotes ignored)
- ✅ Self-votes do not create notifications
- ✅ Respects user's vote notification preferences
- ✅ Creates notification asynchronously using shared async session

**Notification Details:**
- Type: `vote`
- Message: "{voter_username} upvoted your comment"
- Entity: Links to the comment
- Status: Unread by default

### 3. Comment Replies → Reply Notifications
**File:** `app/services/comment_service.py`

When a user replies to a comment, the parent comment author receives a notification:
- ✅ Only replies to other users' comments trigger notifications
- ✅ Self-replies do not create notifications
- ✅ Respects user's reply notification preferences
- ✅ Creates notification asynchronously using shared async session

**Notification Details:**
- Type: `reply`
- Message: "{replier_username} replied to your comment"
- Entity: Links to the reply comment
- Status: Unread by default

## Technical Implementation

### Async Notification Creation Pattern

All notification integrations use fully async architecture with shared database sessions:

```python
# In comment_vote_service.py or comment_service.py
from app.services.notification_service import NotificationService

# Reuse the existing async session from repository
db_session = self.vote_repo.db  # or self.comment_repo.db

# Create notification asynchronously within the same transaction
await NotificationService.create_vote_notification(
    db=db_session,
    recipient_id=comment.user_id,
    actor_id=user_id,
    entity_type='comment',
    entity_id=comment_id,
    vote_value=vote_value
)
```

### Async Database Session Management

The notification service now uses fully async SQLAlchemy:

```python
# All NotificationService methods are async
async def create_notification(
    cls,
    db: AsyncSession,  # Accepts AsyncSession
    user_id: UUID,
    notification_type: str,
    message: str,
    **kwargs
) -> Notification:
    # Use async select() instead of .query()
    stmt = select(UserNotificationPreference).where(
        UserNotificationPreference.user_id == user_id
    )
    result = await db.execute(stmt)
    # ... create notification
    await db.commit()  # Async commit
```

### Preference Checking

Before creating any notification, user preferences are checked:

```python
prefs = NotificationService.get_preferences(db, user_id)

if prefs and prefs.vote_notifications:  # Check relevant preference
    # Create notification
    pass
```

## Files Modified

### Core Integration
1. `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py` - User registration integration
2. `app/services/comment_vote_service.py` - Vote notification integration
3. `app/services/comment_service.py` - Reply notification integration

### Async Conversion
4. `app/services/notification_service.py` - Converted from sync to async SQLAlchemy
5. `app/api/v1/endpoints/notifications.py` - Updated to use AsyncSession

### Test Fixes
6. `tests/integration/test_notification_integrations.py` - Fixed vote endpoint calls
7. `app/api/v1/endpoints/comments.py` - Fixed deprecation warning (regex → pattern)

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Recommendations

1. **User Registration:**
   ```bash
   POST /api/v1/auth/register
   Then GET /api/v1/notifications/preferences
   # Should return default preferences
   ```

2. **Vote Notifications:**
   ```bash
   # User A creates comment
   # User B upvotes comment  
   # User A should receive notification
   GET /api/v1/notifications/
   ```

3. **Reply Notifications:**
   ```bash
   # User A creates comment
   # User B replies to comment
   # User A should receive notification
   GET /api/v1/notifications/
   ```

4. **Preference Respect:**
   ```bash
   # Disable vote notifications
   PUT /api/v1/notifications/preferences {"vote_notifications": false}
   # Upvote should NOT create notification
   ```

### Integration Test Status

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSING** (10/10)

Integration tests fully implemented and passing (`tests/integration/test_notification_integrations.py`).

**Test Classes Passing:**
- `TestUserRegistrationIntegration` (2/2) - Registration preference creation
- `TestVoteNotificationIntegration` (3/3) - Vote notifications
- `TestReplyNotificationIntegration` (3/3) - Reply notifications
- `TestNotificationPreferences` (2/2) - Preference respect

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Fixed vote endpoint test calls to use correct URL format
2. Converted NotificationService from sync to async
3. Fixed event loop mismatch by reusing repository sessions
4. Fixed deprecation warnings in FastAPI/Pydantic

## Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)

- [ ] Mention notifications (`@username` in comments)
- [ ] Article vote notifications (articles have no authors currently)
- [ ] Batch notification delivery for high-volume scenarios
- [ ] Email digest notifications
- [] Push notifications via WebSocket/SSE
- [ ] Notification aggregation ("3 people upvoted your comment")

## Known Limitations

1. **No Article Vote Notifications:** Articles do not have a `user_id` field, so we cannot notify article "authors" when articles are voted on.

2. **No Notification Batching:** Each action creates one notification immediately. High-volume scenarios might benefit from batching.

3. **No WebSocket/SSE:** Notifications are pull-based (polling). Real-time push would require WebSocket or SSE integration.

- ✅ Users receive notifications for meaningful interactions (upvotes and replies)
- ✅ Full control over notification preferences
- ✅ Fully async implementation with no blocking operations
- ✅ All 10 integration tests passing
- ✅ Production-ready and CI/CD compatible
- ✅ Consistent async architecture throughout the application

**Technical Highlights:**
- Converted NotificationService from sync to async SQLAlchemy
- Fixed event loop management issues
- Eliminated ThreadPoolExecutor workarounds
- Proper session management using repository sessions

The notification system is now fully functional, thoroughly tested, and ready for deployment. Future enhancements like mentions, email delivery, and real-time push notifications can be built on this solid foundation.
