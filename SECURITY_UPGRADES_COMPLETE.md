Name: starlette     Version: 0.48.0    ‚úÖ >= 0.47.2
```

### 2. Dependency Conflicts ‚úÖ

```
$ pip check
No broken requirements found.
```

### 3. Import Tests ‚úÖ

```
Testing critical imports...
‚úì FastAPI 0.119.0
‚úì Uvicorn 0.37.0
‚úì SQLAlchemy 2.0.44
‚úì Authlib 1.6.5

‚úÖ All critical imports successful!
```

### 4. Vulnerability Scan Results

```
$ pip-audit --desc
Found 2 known vulnerabilities in 2 packages
```

**Remaining Vulnerabilities:**
1. **ecdsa 0.19.1** (GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp)
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Type:** Timing attack on P-256 curve
   - **Status:** Accepted risk - out of scope for project, not used in critical paths
   - **Mitigation:** Not used for critical cryptographic operations

2. **pip 25.2** (GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph)
   - **Severity:** Low
   - **Type:** Tarfile extraction path traversal
   - **Status:** Fix planned for pip 25.3
   - **Mitigation:** Not installing from untrusted sources in production

**Assessment:** Both remaining vulnerabilities are LOW severity and pose minimal risk to the application in production deployment.
