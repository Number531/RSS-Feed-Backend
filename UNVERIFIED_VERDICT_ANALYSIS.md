# Why Articles Receive UNVERIFIED Verdicts

## Analysis Date: December 2024

---

## Executive Summary

**UNVERIFIED verdicts are NOT bad fact-checks** - they represent the fact-checker's inability to find sufficient evidence to confirm or deny specific claims, which is itself valuable information.

**Key Finding:** UNVERIFIED verdicts occur when:
1. **Specific events cannot be confirmed** (e.g., "happened on Monday")
2. **Source attribution cannot be verified** (e.g., "ISGAP released a report titled X")
3. **Evidence exists for general context but not specific details**

## Case Study #1: Winsome Earle-Sears Article

### Article Details
- **Title:** "Winsome Earle-Sears leads GOP ticket in final 'elevator pitch' to voters before Election Day"
- **Verdict:** UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
- **Credibility Score:** 85/100 (relatively high!)
- **Confidence:** 40% (low confidence)

### Claims Breakdown
- **3 claims analyzed**
- ✅ **2 TRUE** (67%)
- ❓ **1 UNVERIFIED** (33%)

### What Was Verified ✅

**Claim 2: TRUE (100% confidence)**
> "Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares is running to keep his position"

**Verdict:** Confirmed by multiple reputable news sources published in late 2024 and October 2025.

**Claim 3: MOSTLY TRUE (90% confidence)**
> "Earle-Sears stated that Democrat Abigail Spanberger 'hasn't been part of creating any of these jobs'"

**Verdict:** Implicitly confirmed - Earle-Sears did criticize Spanberger's role in job creation.

### What Was UNVERIFIED ❓

**Claim 1: UNVERIFIED (40% confidence)**
> "Winsome Earle-Sears led the GOP ticket in delivering a final message to voters specifically on Monday before Election Day (November 3, 2025)"

**Why UNVERIFIED:**
```
✅ Earle-Sears is Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate - CONFIRMED
✅ Election Day is November 4, 2025 - CONFIRMED
❓ Specific event on November 3 where she "led GOP ticket" - NO EVIDENCE

Reasons:
  ⚠️  Lack of verifiable evidence for specific event
  ⚠️  Specific details (date, event) not found in sources
```

### Analysis

**This is HIGH-QUALITY fact-checking!** Here's why:

1. **Granular verification:** The fact-checker didn't just verify "Earle-Sears is running" (easy) but tried to confirm the **specific timing and event** mentioned in headline
   
2. **Temporal precision:** Distinguishing between "is a candidate" (true) vs. "did X on Monday" (unverified) shows sophistication

3. **High credibility despite unverified:** 85/100 score means "mostly accurate, one detail unconfirmed"

**The Issue:** Fox News headline implies a **specific event** happened that the fact-checker couldn't find evidence for. This could mean:
- Event happened but wasn't covered by sources checked
- Event was scheduled but may not have occurred
- Headline is speculative/promotional rather than reporting completed event

## Case Study #2: Antisemitism Watchdog Report

### Article Details
- **Title:** "Antisemitism watchdog issues scathing 'alarm bell' report on Mamdani as NYC election nears"
- **Verdict:** UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
- **Credibility Score:** 50/100 (moderate)
- **Confidence:** 20% (very low)

### Claims Breakdown
- **3 claims analyzed**
- ✅ **0 TRUE** (0%)
- ❌ **0 FALSE** (0%)
- ❓ **3 UNVERIFIED** (100%)

### What Could NOT Be Verified ❓

**Claim 1: UNVERIFIED (20% confidence)**
> "The Institute for the Study of Global Antisemitism and Policy (ISGAP) released a report titled 'Zohran Mamdani: From SJP to Gracie Mansion?'"

**Why UNVERIFIED:**
```
❓ ISGAP report with this specific title - NO EVIDENCE
✅ Zohran Mamdani is mayoral candidate - CONFIRMED
✅ Mamdani has past association with SJP - CONFIRMED
✅ NYC election is near - CONFIRMED

Reasons:
  ⚠️  Specific report title not found in sources
  ⚠️  ISGAP organization not mentioned in available evidence
```

**Claim 2: UNVERIFIED (20% confidence)**
> "Charles Asher Small, ISGAP's founding director, stated that voters must understand Mamdani's ideological context"

**Why UNVERIFIED:**
```
❓ Specific quote from Charles Asher Small - NO EVIDENCE
❓ ISGAP's involvement - NO EVIDENCE

Reasons:
  ⚠️  Specific statement not found in sources
  ⚠️  Quote attribution cannot be verified
```

**Claim 3: MIXED (60% confidence)**
> "The ISGAP report claims Zohran Mamdani founded the Students for Justice in Palestine chapter at Bowdoin"

**Why MIXED:**
```
✅ Mamdani founded SJP chapter at Bowdoin - CONFIRMED
❓ Information came from ISGAP report - UNVERIFIED
```

### Analysis

**This is APPROPRIATE skepticism!** Here's why:

1. **Source attribution matters:** The article attributes claims to a specific report ("ISGAP report titled X") that the fact-checker cannot find

2. **Quotes need verification:** Direct quotes from named individuals require confirmation

3. **Lower score reflects uncertainty:** 50/100 credibility score = "Some facts confirmed, key claims unverified"

**The Issue:** Fox News is citing a **specific report and specific quotes** that don't appear in the fact-checker's sources. This could mean:
- Report exists but not indexed/available to fact-check API
- Report doesn't exist (false attribution)
- Report title is paraphrased/incorrect
- Source is niche and not covered by mainstream fact-checking sources

## Common Patterns in UNVERIFIED Verdicts

### Pattern 1: Temporal Specificity
**Problem:** Headlines claim specific timing that can't be verified

**Examples:**
- "led GOP ticket **on Monday**" - Can confirm candidacy, not specific day
- "report issued **as election nears**" - Timing vague, can't confirm

**Why it matters:** Time-based claims are often promotional/speculative rather than factual reporting

### Pattern 2: Source Attribution
**Problem:** Article cites specific source/report/quote that can't be found

**Examples:**
- "ISGAP released report titled X" - Report title not found
- "John Doe stated Y" - Quote not in sources

**Why it matters:** False attribution is a red flag for fabrication or misrepresentation

### Pattern 3: Event Specificity
**Problem:** Claims specific event happened without evidence

**Examples:**
- "delivered final elevator pitch" - Event description unconfirmed
- "issued scathing report" - Document existence unconfirmed

**Why it matters:** Events should be verifiable through multiple sources

## Why UNVERIFIED ≠ BAD

### Common Misconception
"UNVERIFIED means the fact-checker failed"

### Reality
"UNVERIFIED means the **article made claims without verifiable evidence**"

### Evidence of Quality Fact-Checking

#### Article #1 (Earle-Sears) - 85/100 Score
```
Verified:     67% of claims (2 of 3)
Unverified:   33% of claims (1 of 3)
Result:       High credibility despite one unverified detail
```

**Why high score?**
- Most facts are accurate (candidate info, election date, policy statements)
- Only specific event timing unconfirmed
- No false information detected

#### Article #2 (Mamdani) - 50/100 Score
```
Verified:     0% of claims (0 of 3)
Unverified:   100% of claims (3 of 3)
Result:       Moderate credibility, significant uncertainty
```

**Why moderate score?**
- Context is accurate (Mamdani's candidacy, SJP history, election timing)
- Primary sourcing (ISGAP report) cannot be confirmed
- No false information, but key claims lack evidence

---

## Comparison: UNVERIFIED vs. FALSE

### FALSE Verdict (Article #8 from previous run: 36/100)
```
Claim: "Trump denied directing DOJ to target Comey, Bolton, James in '60 Minutes' interview"

Evidence:
  ❌ No '60 Minutes' interview with this denial found
  ❌ Multiple sources show Trump DID pressure DOJ
  ❌ Contradictory evidence exists

Result: FALSE (not just unverified)
```

**Key Difference:**
- **UNVERIFIED:** "We can't find evidence to confirm this"
- **FALSE:** "We found evidence that contradicts this"

### UNVERIFIED Verdict (Earle-Sears: 85/100)
```
Claim: "Earle-Sears led GOP ticket in final message on Monday"

Evidence:
  ✅ Earle-Sears is GOP candidate
  ✅ Monday before election is correct date
  ❓ No sources mention specific event on that day
  ✅ No contradictory evidence

Result: UNVERIFIED (not false)
```

**Key Difference:**
- No evidence **contradicts** the claim
- Just no evidence **confirms** the specific detail
- Context is accurate, only timing/event unconfirmed

## Implications for News Consumers

### What UNVERIFIED Tells You

**Article #1 (85/100 - UNVERIFIED):**
> "Most of what's in this article is accurate, but the specific event mentioned in the headline couldn't be confirmed. The candidate info and policy discussions are real, but the timing/specific event may be promotional or scheduled rather than reported."

**Article #2 (50/100 - UNVERIFIED):**
> "The general context is accurate, but the specific report and quotes cited don't appear in fact-check sources. The person and their background are real, but the primary source document can't be verified."

### How to Interpret

**High Score + UNVERIFIED (80-100):**
- Article is mostly accurate
- One or two specific details unconfirmed
- Safe to trust general narrative
- Be skeptical of precise timing/event claims

**Medium Score + UNVERIFIED (50-79):**
- Mixed accuracy
- Key sourcing uncertain
- Verify important claims independently
- Context likely accurate, specifics questionable

**Low Score + UNVERIFIED (0-49):**
- Significant doubts about accuracy
- Multiple unverified claims
- Proceed with extreme caution
- May be speculation or poorly sourced

## Recommendations for API Team

### Enhancement #1: Distinguish Levels of UNVERIFIED

**Current:** Single `UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE` verdict

**Suggested:**
```python
UNVERIFIED_HIGH_CONFIDENCE = "UNVERIFIED - LIKELY ACCURATE"
  # Context confirmed, specific detail unconfirmed, no contradictions
  
UNVERIFIED_MEDIUM_CONFIDENCE = "UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE"
  # Cannot confirm or deny, need more sources
  
UNVERIFIED_LOW_CONFIDENCE = "UNVERIFIED - QUESTIONABLE"
  # Multiple red flags, likely inaccurate but not provably false
```

**Benefits:**
- More nuanced verdicts
- Helps users understand confidence level
- Separates "probably true" from "probably false" unverified claims

### Enhancement #2: Explain What IS Verified

**Current Output:**
```json
{
  "verdict": "UNVERIFIED",
  "summary": "Cannot confirm report exists"
}
```

**Suggested Output:**
```json
{
  "verdict": "UNVERIFIED - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE",
  "summary": "Cannot confirm report exists",
  "verified_facts": [
    "Mamdani is NYC mayoral candidate (TRUE)",
    "Mamdani founded SJP chapter (TRUE)",
    "NYC election is November 2025 (TRUE)"
  ],
  "unverified_facts": [
    "ISGAP report titled 'X' exists (NO EVIDENCE)",
    "Charles Asher Small quote (NO EVIDENCE)"
  ]
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Shows what fact-checker DID confirm
- Clarifies exactly what's uncertain
- Prevents "all or nothing" interpretation

### Enhancement #3: Temporal Context Awareness

**Current Issue:** Article from November 3 claims event "on Monday" but fact-checker doesn't account for publication date

**Suggested:**
```python
def validate_with_temporal_context(claim, article_date):
    """
    Check if claim is about future event vs. past event
    """
    if is_future_event(claim, article_date):
        return {
            "verdict": "UNVERIFIED - FUTURE EVENT",
            "note": "Claim is about scheduled/upcoming event, not historical fact"
        }
```

**Benefits:**
- Distinguishes reporting vs. promotion
- Accounts for article publication timing
- Reduces false UNVERIFIED for legitimate future events

## Conclusion

### Key Findings

1. **UNVERIFIED is valuable information**
   - Tells users: "claims lack evidence"
   - Not the same as "false"
   - Appropriate response to unsourced claims

2. **High scores + UNVERIFIED = Mostly accurate**
   - Article #1: 85/100 with 2/3 claims verified
   - Only specific event timing unconfirmed
   - General narrative is trustworthy

3. **Low scores + UNVERIFIED = Significant doubt**
   - Article #2: 50/100 with 0/3 claims verified
   - Primary sourcing cannot be confirmed
   - Proceed with caution

4. **Fact-checker is working correctly**
   - Granular claim-by-claim validation
   - Distinguishes verified context from unverified specifics
   - Appropriate skepticism about sourcing

### What This Means

**For Frontend:**
- Display UNVERIFIED differently based on credibility score
- Show "Mostly Accurate" badge for 80+ score
- Show "Cannot Verify" badge for <60 score
- List what WAS verified vs. what wasn't

**For Users:**
- UNVERIFIED ≠ FALSE
- High score = mostly trustworthy despite uncertainty
- Low score = significant credibility questions
- Check primary sources independently for important claims

**For API Team:**
- Current system is working well
- Consider adding confidence sub-levels
- Add "verified facts" vs. "unverified facts" breakdown
- Account for temporal context (future vs. past events)
