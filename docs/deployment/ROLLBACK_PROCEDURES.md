# Rollback Procedures - Security Upgrades

**Date**: 2025-06-08  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Emergency rollback procedures in case security upgrades cause production issues

---

## üö® When to Rollback

Execute rollback procedures if any of the following occur after deployment:

### Critical (Immediate Rollback)
- ‚ùå Application fails to start
- ‚ùå Database connectivity lost
- ‚ùå Authentication system fails
- ‚ùå Critical endpoints return 500 errors
- ‚ùå Memory/CPU usage exceeds 90%
- ‚ùå Cascading failures across services

### High (Rollback within 1 hour)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Response times > 2x baseline
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error rate > 5%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Intermittent authentication failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitoring dashboards show red

### Medium (Consider Rollback)
- üü° Non-critical endpoints failing
- üü° Increased latency (< 2x baseline)
- üü° Minor functionality degradation
- üü° Error rate 1-5%

---

## ‚ö° Quick Rollback (5 minutes)

Use this for emergency situations requiring immediate action.

### Step 1: Stop Application (30 seconds)

```bash
# If using systemd
sudo systemctl stop rss-feed-backend

# If using Docker
docker-compose down

# If using screen/tmux
# Find and kill the process
ps aux | grep uvicorn
kill <PID>
```

### Step 2: Activate Environment (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/ej/Downloads/RSS-Feed/backend
source venv/bin/activate  # or your venv path
```

### Step 3: Rollback Dependencies (2-3 minutes)

```bash
# Install old requirements from backup
pip install -r requirements.txt.backup --force-reinstall

# Verify rollback
pip list | grep -E "fastapi|uvicorn|httpx|authlib"

# Expected: Old versions restored
# fastapi 0.104.1
# uvicorn 0.24.0
# httpx 0.25.1
# authlib 1.2.1
```

### Step 4: Restart Application (1 minute)

```bash
# If using systemd
sudo systemctl start rss-feed-backend
sudo systemctl status rss-feed-backend

# If using Docker
docker-compose up -d

# If manual start
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
```

### Step 5: Verify (30 seconds)

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check logs
tail -n 50 /var/log/rss-feed/app.log
```

**Total Time**: ~5 minutes

---

## üîÑ Full Rollback (15 minutes)

Use this for planned rollback with full verification.

### Phase 1: Pre-Rollback

#### 1.1 Document Current State

```bash
# Save current package versions
pip freeze > rollback-snapshot-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt

# Save current logs
cp /var/log/rss-feed/app.log /var/log/rss-feed/app-before-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log

# Save current metrics
curl -s http://localhost:8000/metrics > metrics-before-rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt
```

#### 1.2 Notify Team

```bash
# Send notification (adjust for your system)
echo "ROLLBACK IN PROGRESS: Security upgrades being rolled back" | \
  # Your notification system here
```

#### 1.3 Enable Maintenance Mode (if available)

```bash
# Touch maintenance file
touch /var/www/maintenance.html

# Or update load balancer
# This depends on your infrastructure
```

### Phase 2: Execute Rollback

#### 2.1 Stop All Services

```bash
# Stop application
sudo systemctl stop rss-feed-backend

# Stop Celery workers (if running)
sudo systemctl stop celery-worker
sudo systemctl stop celery-beat

# Verify stopped
systemctl status rss-feed-backend
systemctl status celery-worker
systemctl status celery-beat
```

#### 2.2 Rollback Code (if needed)

```bash
# If you deployed code changes along with dependencies
cd /Users/ej/Downloads/RSS-Feed/backend

# Stash any uncommitted changes
git stash

# Rollback to previous commit
git log --oneline | head -5  # Find commit before security updates
git reset --hard <COMMIT_HASH>

# Or checkout previous branch
git checkout <PREVIOUS_BRANCH>
```

#### 2.3 Rollback Dependencies

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Clear cache
pip cache purge

# Install old requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt.backup --force-reinstall

# Verify critical packages
pip list | grep -E "fastapi|uvicorn|httpx|authlib|h11|h2|certifi|idna|urllib3|starlette"
```

#### 2.4 Verify Environment

```bash
# Run quick import test
python -c "from app import main; print('‚úÖ Imports OK')"

# Check for broken dependencies
pip check
```

### Phase 3: Restart Services

#### 3.1 Start Application

```bash
# Start main application
sudo systemctl start rss-feed-backend

# Wait for startup
sleep 10

# Check status
systemctl status rss-feed-backend
```

#### 3.2 Start Celery (if using)

```bash
sudo systemctl start celery-worker
sudo systemctl start celery-beat

systemctl status celery-worker
systemctl status celery-beat
```

#### 3.3 Verify Services

```bash
# Check all services are running
systemctl list-units | grep rss-feed
systemctl list-units | grep celery
```

### Phase 4: Verification

#### 4.1 Health Checks

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || echo "‚ùå Health check failed"

# Test metrics endpoint
curl -f http://localhost:8000/metrics | head -5 || echo "‚ùå Metrics failed"

# Test API endpoints
curl -f http://localhost:8000/api/v1/feeds || echo "‚ùå API failed"
```

#### 4.2 Monitor Logs

```bash
# Watch application logs
tail -f /var/log/rss-feed/app.log

# Watch for errors
tail -f /var/log/rss-feed/app.log | grep -i error
```

#### 4.3 Check Metrics

```bash
# CPU usage
top -b -n 1 | grep uvicorn

# Memory usage
ps aux | grep uvicorn | awk '{print $4}'

# Open connections
netstat -an | grep :8000 | wc -l
```

### Phase 5: Post-Rollback

#### 5.1 Disable Maintenance Mode

```bash
# Remove maintenance file
rm /var/www/maintenance.html

# Update load balancer
# Depends on your infrastructure
```

#### 5.2 Notify Team

```bash
echo "ROLLBACK COMPLETE: Services restored to previous version" | \
  # Your notification system here
```

#### 5.3 Document Issues

```bash
# Create incident report
cat > rollback-incident-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).md << 'EOF'
# Rollback Incident Report

## üîê Security Considerations

### After Rollback

**Important**: Rolling back means returning to vulnerable versions!

#### Immediate Actions (Within 1 hour)
- [ ] Re-enable WAF rules to compensate for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Increase logging and monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerts for exploitation attempts
- [ ] Restrict external access if possible
- [ ] Document vulnerable state

#### Short-term (Within 24 hours)
- [ ] Review access logs for exploitation attempts
- [ ] Apply temporary mitigations
- [ ] Schedule fix deployment
- [ ] Communicate risk to stakeholders

#### Medium-term (Within 1 week)
- [ ] Fix issues that caused rollback
- [ ] Complete full security re-testing
- [ ] Re-deploy with fixes
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem

**Risk Level After Rollback**: üî¥ HIGH
- 89 known vulnerabilities re-introduced
- Critical auth vulnerabilities active
- Request smuggling vectors re-opened
- Monitoring reduced during rollback
