## 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS

### 1. RSS Feed/Source Management Endpoints ⚠️ **MISSING ENTIRELY**

**Current State:** RSS sources exist in database but NO API endpoints to manage them!

**What's Missing:**
```
GET    /feeds              # List all available RSS feeds
GET    /feeds/{id}         # Get single feed details
POST   /feeds              # Add new RSS feed (admin only)
PUT    /feeds/{id}         # Update feed (admin only)
DELETE /feeds/{id}         # Delete feed (admin only)
GET    /feeds/categories   # List feed categories
```

**Database Model Exists:** ✅ `app/models/rss_source.py`
- Has all necessary fields (name, url, category, health tracking)
- Relationships already defined
- BUT no API endpoints to expose this!

**Impact:**
- ❌ Users cannot see what feeds are available
- ❌ Admins cannot add/remove feeds via API
- ❌ Frontend cannot display feed sources
- ❌ No way to subscribe/unsubscribe to specific feeds

**Recommendation:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - Implement immediately**

---

### 2. User Subscriptions/Feed Preferences ⚠️ **MISSING**

**What's Missing:**
```
GET    /users/me/subscriptions        # Get user's feed subscriptions
POST   /users/me/subscriptions        # Subscribe to feed
DELETE /users/me/subscriptions/{id}   # Unsubscribe from feed
GET    /users/me/feed-preferences     # Get feed display preferences
PUT    /users/me/feed-preferences     # Update feed preferences
```

**Current Problem:**
- All users see ALL articles from ALL feeds
- No way to filter by preferred feeds
- Cannot customize feed experience

**Required Database Changes:**
- New table: `user_feed_subscriptions`
  ```sql
  - user_id (FK)
  - feed_id (FK)
  - subscribed_at
  - notification_enabled
  ```

**Impact:**
- ❌ Users get overwhelmed with irrelevant content
- ❌ No personalization
- ❌ Cannot mute unwanted feeds

**Recommendation:** 🔴 **CRITICAL - Core UX feature**

---

### 3. File Upload Endpoint ⚠️ **MISSING**

**What's Missing:**
```
POST   /uploads/avatar           # Upload user avatar
POST   /uploads/images           # Upload article images (if needed)
DELETE /uploads/{filename}       # Delete uploaded file
```

**Current Problem:**
- Users endpoint accepts `avatar_url` as string
- No way to actually upload avatar files
- Assumes external hosting only

**Required:**
- File upload handling with FastAPI
- Image validation (size, format)
- Storage (local/S3/CloudFlare R2)
- Image optimization/resizing
- Security checks

**Impact:**
- ❌ Users cannot upload custom avatars
- ❌ Must use external URLs only
- ❌ Poor user experience

**Recommendation:** 🟡 **HIGH - Important UX feature**

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY GAPS

### 4. User Statistics Endpoint 📊 **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Current State:** Endpoint exists but returns 501 Not Implemented!

```python
# app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py
@router.get("/me/stats")
async def get_current_user_stats():
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_501_NOT_IMPLEMENTED,
        detail="User statistics endpoint not yet implemented"
    )
```

**What Should Return:**

  "most_active_category": "technology",
  "comments_received": 34,

}
```

**Required Queries:**
